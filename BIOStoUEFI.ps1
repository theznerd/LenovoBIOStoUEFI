.SYNOPSIS
    Allows you to configure SecureBoot/UEFI settings, as well as Virtualization 
    Technology and TPM for Credential Guard and Device Guard. This script is
    designed to work on both ThinkPad and ThinkCentre machines.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script connects to the WMI instances for Lenovo machines, and then
    configures the requested settings. This script is designed to be used
    as part of a task sequence where you want to convert from legacy BIOS
    to UEFI and at the same time prepare the machine for Credential Guard
    and Device Guard.

    IMPORTANT NOTE: For ThinkCentre machines, this requires a later BIOS
    revision than may have come with your machine. I only had access to 
    the following models during my testing:

    M93p - Min BIOS Rev required: FBKTCAA (9/18/2016)
    M900 - Min BIOS Rev required: FWKT5AA (10/4/2016)

.PARAMETER Verbose
    This script is verbose enabled. Use this switch to get verbose output.

.PARAMETER BTU
    A switch to enable configuration of BIOS to UEFI configuration.

.PARAMETER CGDG
    A switch to enable virtualization technology and TPM (if not currently enabled) - requires the BTU switch

.PARAMETER BIOSPassword [string]
    If you have a supervisor password set on your machines, you will need to input it here.

.PARAMETER LogPath [string]
    This is a full path to a log file for troubleshooting the script. If a value is set here logging will be enabled.

.PARAMETER WhatIf
    A switch to keep the script from actually performing any changes to BIOS. Use in conjunction with the -Verbose switch to see what the script would have done.
